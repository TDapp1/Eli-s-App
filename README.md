ELI's APP — AAC for head, eye. and touch control

ELI's APP is a simple, customizable communication app for people who are non‑speaking or have limited speech. It’s built so selection can be done with head movement or eye gaze (no touch required), with a calm, child‑friendly design and full control over tiles and settings.

Who it’s for:
ELI's APP is for anyone who benefits from picture‑based communication, including people with:
Cerebral palsy
Autism (including non‑speaking or minimally speaking)
Apraxia of speech
Down syndrome
Rett syndrome
Angelman syndrome
ALS or other motor conditions
Aphasia (e.g. after stroke)
Other complex communication needs

How it works:
Tiles — Start with four tiles (e.g. Hungry, Yes, All Done, More). Each tile speaks its label when selected.
Head or eye control — Use the iPad’s built‑in Head Tracking (Settings → Accessibility → Pointer Control) so a pointer follows head movement. Hold the pointer on a tile for a short dwell time (e.g. 2 seconds) to select it. No tap needed.
Touch — Tapping a tile also works for setup or for users who can tap.
Voice — Built‑in speech speaks the label when a tile is selected. You can choose the voice in the app.
Customization — Add, remove, and reorder tiles; change labels; use app icons or your own photos (cropped to a square). Adjust dwell time, pointer sensitivity, and appearance (e.g. soft pastels, high contrast).
Privacy — Tiles and settings stay on the device.

Designed for growth:
The app starts simple (four tiles, no edge scrolling) so it’s easy to learn. As ability and needs grow, caregivers can turn on more options (e.g. edge scrolling), add tiles, and adjust sensitivity so the app grows with the user.

Accessibility:
Head tracking (system Accessibility) for pointer control
Dwell selection so a steady gaze or head hold selects a tile
Optional larger hit areas and smoothing to reduce accidental selections
Themed, readable visuals

ELI's APP is made for families and caregivers who want a straightforward, customizable AAC option that works with head and eye control on iPad.

Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy for ELI's APP
Last updated: [Add date]
ELI's APP (“the App”) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app for iPad. This policy describes how the App handles information.
Data we collect
We do not collect any personal data.
The App does not create an account, and we do not collect, store, or receive your name, email, or any other identifying information.
Data stored on your device
All data created in the App stays on your device:
Tiles – Labels, order, and optional custom images you add (e.g. from your photo library) are saved only in the App’s storage on your iPad.
Settings – Choices such as dwell time, voice, theme, and head/eye settings are stored only on your device.
Custom images – If you add photos to tiles, those images are saved only in the App’s local storage and are not sent to us or anyone else.
We do not have access to this data. It is not transmitted to our servers or to any third party.
Photo library access
The App can access your photo library only when you choose “Choose photo” (or similar) to set or change a tile image. We use that access only to let you pick and crop a photo for a tile. Photos are stored only on your device within the App. We do not upload, copy, or use your photos for any other purpose.
You can deny photo access; the App will still work, and you can use app-generated icons instead of custom photos.
Speech (text-to-speech)
When you select a tile, the App uses the device’s built-in text-to-speech to speak the tile’s label. This happens entirely on your device. We do not receive or process any speech or audio.
Children and vulnerable users
The App is designed for use by people who need AAC, including children and people with disabilities. We do not collect any personal data from anyone, including children. All use of the App and its data stays on the user’s device under the control of the device owner or caregiver.
Third parties
The App does not include analytics, advertising, or other third-party code that collects or shares data. We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any.
Data retention and deletion
Because we do not collect data, there is nothing for us to retain or delete on our side. All App data is stored only on your device. If you delete the App, that local data is removed with it. You can also remove individual tiles or images in the App’s settings.
Changes to this policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. For the App Store listing, we will use the privacy policy URL you provide there so you can update the text on your website without submitting a new app version for this alone.

Summary: ELI's APP does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All tiles, settings, and optional photos stay only on your device.
