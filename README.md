ELI's APP — AAC for head, eye. and touch control

ELI's APP is a simple, customizable communication app for people who are non‑speaking or have limited speech. It’s built so selection can be done with head movement or eye gaze (no touch required), with a calm, child‑friendly design and full control over tiles and settings.

Who it’s for:
ELI's APP is for anyone who benefits from picture‑based communication, including people with:
Cerebral palsy
Autism (including non‑speaking or minimally speaking)
Apraxia of speech
Down syndrome
Rett syndrome
Angelman syndrome
ALS or other motor conditions
Aphasia (e.g. after stroke)
Other complex communication needs

How it works:
Tiles — Start with four tiles (e.g. Hungry, Yes, All Done, More). Each tile speaks its label when selected.
Head or eye control — Use the iPad’s built‑in Head Tracking (Settings → Accessibility → Pointer Control) so a pointer follows head movement. Hold the pointer on a tile for a short dwell time (e.g. 2 seconds) to select it. No tap needed.
Touch — Tapping a tile also works for setup or for users who can tap.
Voice — Built‑in speech speaks the label when a tile is selected. You can choose the voice in the app.
Customization — Add, remove, and reorder tiles; change labels; use app icons or your own photos (cropped to a square). Adjust dwell time, pointer sensitivity, and appearance (e.g. soft pastels, high contrast).
Privacy — Tiles and settings stay on the device.

Designed for growth:
The app starts simple (four tiles, no edge scrolling) so it’s easy to learn. As ability and needs grow, caregivers can turn on more options (e.g. edge scrolling), add tiles, and adjust sensitivity so the app grows with the user.

Accessibility:
Head tracking (system Accessibility) for pointer control
Dwell selection so a steady gaze or head hold selects a tile
Optional larger hit areas and smoothing to reduce accidental selections
Themed, readable visuals

ELI's APP is made for families and caregivers who want a straightforward, customizable AAC option that works with head and eye control on iPad.
